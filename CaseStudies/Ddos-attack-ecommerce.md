## 📌 Incident Overview  
A small e-commerce business experienced a sudden outage during its peak sales period.  
Customers reported being unable to access the website for several hours.  
Investigation revealed that the company was targeted by a **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack**, overwhelming its servers with malicious traffic.

## 🔎 Root Cause  
- Attackers used a **botnet** of compromised IoT devices to flood the company’s servers.  
- The website’s infrastructure lacked **traffic filtering** and **load balancing**.  
- No **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** or DDoS protection was in place.

- Loss of sales revenue during peak shopping time.  
- Damage to customer trust and brand reputation.

## 🛠️ Incident Response Actions  
1. **Identified** abnormal traffic patterns using network monitoring tools.  
2. Worked with the **ISP** to block malicious traffic at the upstream level.  
3. Temporarily **scaled infrastructure** to absorb traffic spikes.  
4. Implemented **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** and **rate limiting**.  
5. Migrated to a **CDN with built-in DDoS protection** (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai).

## ✅ Lessons Learned  
- Businesses must prepare for DDoS attacks, especially e-commerce platforms.
