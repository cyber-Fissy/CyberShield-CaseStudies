## 📌 Incident Overview  
A consulting firm discovered that a recently resigned employee had copied sensitive client data onto a personal USB drive before leaving the company.  
The ex-employee later attempted to sell the data on a dark web forum.  

---

## 🔎 Root Cause  
- Lack of restrictions on the use of **removable media (USB drives)**.  
- Weak **data loss prevention (DLP) policies**.  
- No monitoring in place for **large data transfers** before employee exit.  

---

## ⚠️ Impact  
- Exposure of sensitive client information.  
- Risk of reputational damage and legal consequences.  
- Financial losses due to potential lawsuits and non-compliance fines.

## 🛠️ Incident Response Actions  
1. **Detected** suspicious data postings on a dark web monitoring tool.  
2. Conducted **internal investigation** to trace activity back to the former employee.  
3. Reported the incident to **law enforcement** and initiated legal action.  
4. Implemented stricter **access control policies** and **USB restrictions**.  
5. Rolled out **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions** to monitor file transfers.

## ✅ Lessons Learned  
- Insider threats are as dangerous as external attacks.  
- Strong **offboarding procedures** are critical when employees leave.  
- Organizations must deploy **DLP tools** to monitor sensitive data.  
- **Regular audits** and monitoring can detect unusual data activity early.
