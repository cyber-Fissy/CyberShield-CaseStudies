## 🔎 The 5 W's  

- **Who:** An organized group of unethical hackers  
- **What:** A ransomware security incident  
- **Where:** At a healthcare company  
- **When:** Tuesday, 9:00 a.m.  
- **Why:** The incident happened because unethical hackers accessed the company's systems using a phishing attack.  
  After gaining access, they launched ransomware, encrypting critical files.  
  The attackers' motivation appeared to be **financial**, as the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.

## 🗒️ Additional Notes  
1. How could the healthcare company prevent an incident like this from occurring again?  
2. Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key?
