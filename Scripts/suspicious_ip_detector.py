Suspicious IP Detector
Author: Akinola Fisayo
Experience: 3 Years Cybersecurity

Description:
    This script scans a log file for suspicious IP addresses. 
    An IP is considered suspicious if it appears more than a set threshold 
    (e.g., repeated failed logins from the same IP).

Usage:
    - Run the script
    - Enter the log file path (e.g., server_logs.txt)
    - Enter the threshold (e.g., 5)
    - The script will print all IPs that exceed the threshold.
